Task Craftr is a personal project designed to showcase my Android development skills. The app is a lightweight task manager that integrates with [Google Tasks](https://developers.google.com/tasks) through its REST API, adhering to a clean and modern MVVM architecture. I’ve used [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose) and [Material Design 3](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/designsystems/material3) to create a smooth and visually appealing UI, while also incorporating Room for local data persistence and OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.

This project highlights the breadth of my Android knowledge, from API integration and UI design to database management and CI/CD setup. It’s designed not just as a functioning task manager, but as a demonstration of my ability to deliver well-structured, maintainable, and scalable Android apps.
